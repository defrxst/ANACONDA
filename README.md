# ANACONDA
A GUI based Discord webhook multitool, not many features atm but it gets the job done for rat hunters.
# USAGE
Run the requirements .bat file to install the requirements, then run "run.bat"
Make sure to set the mode every time, even for multi hooks
The "times to send" doesn't work btw i forgot to add it
